# Next.js 15 Client-Side Data Fetching Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application involving client-side data fetching from an API route.  The application consists of three files:

* `pages/index.js`: The home page, with a link to the about page.
* `pages/about.js`: The about page, which fetches data from the API route using `useEffect` and displays it.
* `pages/api/hello.js`: A simple API route that returns a JSON response.

The issue is that the `about` page either renders blank or throws an error when attempting to fetch data. The API route itself functions correctly.  The provided solution addresses this problem.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You should see either a blank page or an error message in the browser's developer console. 

## Solution

The solution is provided in `bugSolution.js` and corrects the data fetching logic in the About page component to correctly handle the asynchronous operation and potential errors.
